# {{PROJECT}} — Workflow

## Files

- **resume.md** — current project state, open threads, navigation (thin gateway)
- **iterations.md** — iteration narratives and project history (append-only archive)
- **tasks/** — active tasks; **tasks/done/** — completed
- **commands/** — slash commands (/restart, /wrap)
- **doc/** — stable project reference: architecture, design decisions, testing (source-controlled)

## Workflow Rules

- **Never commit without explicit human permission.** Stage files and
  update commit.msg freely, but the actual git commit requires human approval.
- **Never commit AI context files.** CLAUDE.md, commit.msg, and anything
  under .claude/ are local-only.
- **Git commit messages are the project's history.** Write them to be
  clear, detailed, and self-sufficient.

## The Pair Programming Paradigm

### The AI's Role: Expert Implementation

- Expert coder with deep technical knowledge
- Investigate problems thoroughly BEFORE implementing fixes
- Present findings and action plans for review
- Implement solutions only after architectural approval

### The Human's Role: Architectural Vision

- Context that spans the entire project across many days and iterations
- Understanding of long-term maintainability goals
- Guide architectural decisions and approve implementation approaches

### Critical Anti-Pattern: Premature Implementation

Never jump to coding short-term fixes without investigation.

## Investigation-First Workflow

### 1. Plan Mode Default

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity
- After creating a plan in plan mode, immediately move it from `~/.claude/plans/`
  to the project's `agentctx/tasks/` directory — plans must live in the vault,
  not in the ephemeral Claude plans directory

### 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- One tack per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction from the user: update lessons with the pattern
- Write rules that prevent the same mistake
- Review lessons at session start

### 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- No task is "done" until the user says it is and does the actual commit
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- No warnings or diagnostic messages in committed code

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report: generate a plan and review with the user
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then plan to resolve them
- Never fix a test without understanding the root cause

## Task Management

1. Write plan using `vv_manage_task` with `action: create`
2. Check in before starting implementation
3. Track progress and explain changes at each step
4. Add review section to the task file
5. When complete: use `vv_manage_task` with `action: retire`

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible but no simpler
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure close to 80% unit test coverage for code changes

Read resume.md for current project state and open threads. Consult doc/ files
for stable reference material (architecture, design decisions, test inventory).
