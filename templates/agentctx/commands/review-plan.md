Perform a critical architecture review of a task plan before implementation begins.

This is a senior staff engineer review. The goal is to find real problems —
not rubber-stamp the plan. Read the plan, read the code it references, and
identify what will actually go wrong.

## Inputs

If no argument is given, use `vv_list_tasks` to find all active tasks and
review them. If a filename is given, use `vv_get_task` to read only that task.

## Step 1: Read the plan

Read the task file(s) and extract:
- What code it proposes to modify or create
- What assumptions it makes about existing abstractions
- The proposed phase ordering and dependencies

## Step 2: Validate against the codebase

For every claim the plan makes about existing code, **read the actual source**.
Do not trust the plan's characterization of coupling, interfaces, or behavior.
Specific checks:

- **Function signatures**: Does the plan accurately describe them?
- **Coupling claims**: If the plan says "loose coupling" or "reuse directly",
  verify by reading the function body. Look for hidden dependencies (subprocess
  calls, global state, hardcoded values, implicit assumptions).
- **Data flow**: Trace how data actually moves through the pipeline. Does the
  plan's proposed integration point actually work?
- **Naming and constants**: Are there hardcoded strings, fallback values, or
  field names that assume a single source/context?

Use subagents liberally to parallelize investigation of independent components.

## Step 3: Structured review

Produce a review covering these categories. Be specific — reference file paths
and line numbers. Skip categories where there are no findings.

### Factual errors
Where the plan misunderstands or misrepresents the codebase. Include the
plan's claim and the actual code behavior.

### Architectural concerns
Is the approach sound? Anti-patterns? Better alternatives? Consider:
- Flag-argument anti-patterns (optional fields that create hidden code paths)
- Premature or missing abstractions
- Whether the refactoring preserves existing behavior

### Risk assessment
What could go wrong? What is the plan underestimating? Consider:
- File locking and concurrency
- Backward compatibility of schema/index changes
- External dependencies (stability, size, transitive deps)
- Edge cases the plan does not address

### Performance concerns
Identify bottlenecks, quadratic behavior, unnecessary I/O. Consider the
expected data volume and whether the approach scales.

### Dependency concerns
For any new dependency: actual binary size impact, transitive dependency count,
maintenance status, alternatives. Verify the plan's size claims against reality.

### Missing considerations
What did the plan forget? Check for:
- Commands that will silently break with the new data
- Fallback strings or defaults that assume a single source
- Migration needs for existing data
- Test strategy gaps

### Opportunities
What could be done better? Richer data available? Simpler approach?
Existing code that could be leveraged?

### Phasing critique
Is the phase ordering correct? Look for:
- Dependencies between phases that force a different ordering
- Phases that cannot be tested independently
- Work that is deferred but should be concurrent (e.g., test fixtures)

## Step 4: Severity ranking

Rank all findings by severity:

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Critical** | Will cause incorrect behavior or build failure. Must fix before implementation. |
| **High** | Significant design flaw or risk. Should fix before implementation. |
| **Medium** | Suboptimal but workable. Fix during implementation. |
| **Low** | Minor improvement. Address if convenient. |

## Step 5: Present to user

Present the review as a structured summary with the highest-severity items
first. For each critical or high item, include:
- What the plan says
- What the code actually does
- The recommended fix

End with a clear recommendation: proceed as-is, revise the plan first, or
investigate further before deciding.

## Anti-patterns to avoid in the review

- Do not praise the plan. Focus only on problems and improvements.
- Do not repeat the plan back. The user has already read it.
- Do not speculate about code behavior — read the source.
- Do not flag theoretical risks that cannot happen given the architecture.
- Do not suggest adding abstractions "for future extensibility" unless a
  concrete third case is imminent.
