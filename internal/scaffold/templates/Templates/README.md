# Templates

These are [Templater](https://github.com/SilverzoneDev/Templater) templates for manually creating notes in Obsidian.

**Note:** Auto-generated notes from the hook pipeline use a different structure and do not use these templates. These are for when you want to create a note by hand inside Obsidian.

## Available Templates

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `session-summary.md` | Quick session log |
| `session-detailed.md` | Detailed session with all sections |
| `knowledge-note.md` | Knowledge note (decision, pattern, or learning) |

## Prerequisites

Install the [Templater](https://github.com/SilverzoneDev/Templater) community plugin in Obsidian and set this folder as the template folder.
