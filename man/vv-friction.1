.TH VV-FRICTION 1 "2026-02-28" "vv v0.3.0-12-g070e604-dirty" "Vibe-Vault Manual"
.SH NAME
vv-friction \- show friction analysis and correction patterns
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vv friction [\-\-project <name>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Analyzes friction signals from the session index: correction density,
token efficiency, file retry patterns, error cycles, and recurring
open threads. Shows per\-project aggregates and identifies high\-friction
sessions.
.PP
Friction scores range from 0 (smooth) to 100 (high friction). Sessions
scoring ≥ 40 are flagged as high\-friction. Run vv reprocess to generate
friction data if none is available.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-project <name>
Show friction for a specific project only
