.TH VV-HOOK 1 "2026-02-27" "vv v0.3.0-5-ga5db20f-dirty" "Vibe-Vault Manual"
.SH NAME
vv-hook \- Claude Code hook handler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vv hook [install | uninstall | \-\-event <name>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a JSON payload from stdin as delivered by Claude Code's hook
system. Handles two event types:
.PP
  SessionEnd — parses transcript, writes a finalized session note
  Stop       — captures a mid\-session checkpoint (no LLM enrichment)
.PP
Checkpoint notes are provisional: a subsequent Stop overwrites the
previous checkpoint, and SessionEnd finalizes it. Clear events and
unknown events are silently ignored.
.PP
This command is meant to be called by Claude Code, not directly.
.PP
Subcommands:
  vv hook install     Add vv hooks to ~/.claude/settings.json
  vv hook uninstall   Remove vv hooks from ~/.claude/settings.json
.SH OPTIONS

.B \-\-event <name>
Override the hook event type (default: read from stdin)
